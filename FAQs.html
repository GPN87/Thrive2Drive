 <h3>How do I get my Driver's licence?</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p> Under the NSW licensing scheme, you need to log at least 120 hours driving experience, including 20 hours of night driving to qualify for a driving test. The driving test is a practical, on-road test that you take with a Service NSW testing officer. It focuses on hazard perception and has been designed for learners with extensive driving experience.</p></li>
